**Cut your Anthropic API bill by routing every request to the cheapest Claude model that can handle it — Haiku, Sonnet, or Opus.** `claude-router` is a self-hosted, drop-in proxy: point any Anthropic-compatible app (Claude Code, Cursor, Cline, or your own SDK code) at it with one environment variable and get automatic, complexity-aware model routing — **zero code changes, no SaaS in your request path, no per-token markup**. Every response reports exactly what you saved.

```text
[claude-router] → haiku  (heuristic, 0ms) | cost: $0.0010 | saved: $0.0030 vs claude-sonnet-5
[claude-router] → opus   (hybrid, 48ms)   | cost: $0.0890 | extra: $0.0740 vs claude-sonnet-5
```

## Is this for you?

**If you pay per token** (Anthropic API, Amazon Bedrock, or Google Vertex) **and your traffic is a mix of easy and hard requests.** The router skims the easy majority down to Haiku/Sonnet and reserves Opus for what actually needs it — **35% on agentic coding traffic**, [measured](research/2026-07-21-end-to-end-savings.md) by replaying 200 real turns through the published proxy.

## Features

| | |
|---|---|
| 🔌 **Zero code changes** | Point any Anthropic app at the proxy via `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, or `import` it as a library. |
| 🧠 **Evidence-based routing** | Conjunctive gates on request shape, not a keyword score. Sonnet is the default; leaving it needs positive evidence. See [research/](research/) for the measurements behind it. |
| 🛟 **Quality-safe** | Sonnet floor for tool-using sessions, plus auto-escalation on truncation/refusal and auto-fallback on rate limits. |
| 📊 **Measurable** | Every call reports exact cents saved vs your baseline, with lifetime `stats` and a live dashboard. |
| 💯 **Correct by construction** | Per-tier parameter normalization (so routed requests don't 400) and prompt-cache-aware pricing. |
| 🏠 **Self-hosted & Claude-only** | No third party sees your traffic; tuned specifically for the Haiku/Sonnet/Opus/Fable tiers. |

---

## Quick start

### Claude Code (recommended)

Two commands on **Windows, macOS, or Linux**:

```bash
npm install -g @sheruq/claude-router
claude-router install --force-route
# open a new terminal, then use `claude` normally — every call is auto-routed
```

> Install **globally** (not via `npx`) when using `install`: login autostart points at the installed CLI, and the `claude-router` command must stay on your PATH for `status` / `stop` / `doctor`.

`install` starts the proxy in the background (verifying it's healthy before reporting success), registers it to start on login, sets `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, and adds a Claude Code statusline — per OS:

| OS | Autostart | Env var |
|----|-----------|---------|
| **Windows** | HKCU Run key | `setx` (applies to new terminals) |
| **macOS** | LaunchAgent | block in `~/.zshrc` |
| **Linux** | systemd user unit (graceful fallback) | block in `~/.bashrc` / `~/.zshrc` |

Manage it anytime:

```bash
claude-router status    # health, routing stats, install state
claude-router stats     # lifetime savings + per-day breakdown
claude-router logs -f   # follow the daemon log
claude-router doctor    # diagnose setup problems
claude-router stop      # stop the background proxy
claude-router uninstall # remove everything install added
```

Watch routing live in the logs, or open the dashboard at `http://localhost:4000/dashboard`.

> **Why `--force-route`?** Claude Code always pins a model, so the proxy must override it to route by complexity. The router reconciles model-specific parameters with the tier it picks (see [How it works](#how-it-works)), so force-routing never 400s on Claude Code's adaptive-thinking / effort settings. Drop the flag if you want explicit model requests to pass through untouched.

### Any app, without installing

**1. Start the proxy** in one terminal:

```bash
npx @sheruq/claude-router start --port 4000 --force-route --verbose
```

**2. Point your app at it** in another:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000
claude
```

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell)
$env:ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL = "http://localhost:4000"
claude
```

---

## How it works

For each request the proxy classifies the task, routes to the right tier, calls the API, and returns the response plus `x-router-*` headers:

- **Route** — `model: "auto"` (or omitted) is classified and routed. An explicit model passes through unchanged **unless** `--force-route` is set.
- **Coordinator pin** *(optional)* — with `--session-model <tier>`, the Claude Code **main session** is pinned to that tier (e.g. `opus` for a large context window and no early compaction) while subagents still route by evidence. It keys off the gateway protocol's `x-claude-code-agent-id` header, which Claude Code sets only on subagent requests — so a request without it is the coordinator. Needs `--force-route` (otherwise the client's pinned model already passes through). See [Pin the coordinator session](#pin-the-coordinator-session).
- **Sonnet by default** — leaving it needs positive evidence. Gates are *conjunctive*, so coincidental keyword matches can't sum into an expensive verdict.
- **Loop-position aware** — a turn answering a `tool_result` is a mid-loop step, and those are largely tier-insensitive. Agentic turns never reach Haiku unless `routing.allowHaikuInAgentic: true`.
- **Auto-retry** — a truncated or refused response escalates one tier and retries.
- **Auto-fallback** — a rate-limited (429) tier falls back to the next tier up.
- **Parameter normalization** — the router owns the model, so it adapts model-coupled params to the chosen tier (otherwise a request built for one model 400s on another). Haiku: strips `thinking` and `output_config.effort`. Sonnet/Opus/Fable: strips `temperature`/`top_p`/`top_k` and converts a fixed `thinking.budget_tokens` to adaptive thinking; Fable additionally rejects *disabled* thinking, so that is dropped too. Your `messages`, `system`, `tools`, and `max_tokens` are never touched.

### Classification modes

| Mode | Overhead | How it decides |
|------|----------|----------------|
| `heuristic` | ~0ms | Conjunctive gates on request shape: tool use, loop position, message count, length, code fences, explicit depth markers. |
| `ai` | one Haiku call (~$0.00004) | Asks Haiku to rate task complexity 1–3. |
| `hybrid` *(default)* | 0ms, or one Haiku call | Gates first; asks Haiku only when no gate fired and routing fell through to the default. |

Every decision carries a `reason` (e.g. `agentic:mid-loop`), so routing is auditable. **Fable** is opt-in (`routing.allowFable`). AI classification is resilient by design — results are cached (LRU 500), calls time out at 1.5s, and any failure falls back to the heuristic, so a Haiku outage never blocks a request.

### Pin the coordinator session

Claude Code's main interactive session is your coordinator — it holds the growing plan and delegates work to subagents. If it routes to Sonnet, its 200k context window fills fast and compaction kicks in early. `--session-model opus` keeps that one session on Opus (large window, no early compaction) while everything the router does for **subagents** stays intact:

```bash
claude-router start --force-route --session-model opus
# or in ~/.claude-router/config.json:  "sessionModel": "opus"
```

How it tells them apart: Claude Code sets the `x-claude-code-agent-id` header **only** on requests from a subagent it spawned ([gateway protocol](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/llm-gateway-protocol)). A request without it is the coordinator, so it gets pinned (classifier skipped, `x-router-classifier: pinned`); a request with it routes by evidence as usual. To route subagents down to cheaper tiers, give them lower models in their `.claude/agents/*.md` frontmatter — the pin never touches them. Only takes effect under `--force-route`; without it, the client's explicit model already passes through untouched.

The pin also requires the request to **carry tools**, which every real coordinator turn does. Claude Code's own meta-calls — generating a session title, summarising a conversation — arrive without the agent-id header too, but with no tools and the conversation quoted in `<session>…</session>`. Those keep routing by evidence, so pinning `opus` doesn't pay Opus rates to name a session.

---

## Configuration

Set defaults once in `~/.claude-router/config.json` instead of passing flags. **CLI flags always override the file.** Scaffold it with `claude-router init --force-route --port 4000`.

```json
{
  "port": 4000,
  "classifier": "hybrid",
  "forceRoute": true,
  "verbose": false,
  "sessionModel": "opus",
  "tiers": {
    "haiku": "claude-haiku-4-5",
    "sonnet": "claude-sonnet-5",
    "opus": "claude-opus-4-8"
  },
  "pricing": {
    "claude-opus-4-8": { "input": 5.0, "output": 25.0 }
  },
  "routing": {
    "haikuMax": 30,
    "opusMin": 70,
    "hybridBand": [40, 60],
    "aiTimeoutMs": 1500,
    "classifyCacheSize": 500,
    "allowHaikuInAgentic": false
  }
}
```

- **`sessionModel`** — pin the Claude Code coordinator session to a tier (subagents still route). See [Pin the coordinator session](#pin-the-coordinator-session).
- **`tiers`** — override which model ID each tier maps to.
- **`pricing`** — override `$/1M` token rates used for savings math (handy for enterprise/negotiated rates).
- **`routing`** — tune the classifier. `allowHaikuInAgentic: true` lets clearly-trivial tool-using turns reach Haiku (off by default — see the [agentic floor](#how-it-works)).

```

**Something not routing?** Run `claude-router doctor` — it checks the Node version, config validity, proxy health on your port, `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, credentials, stale daemon state, autostart, and the statusline, with a fix hint for anything that fails.

## Pricing & savings

Each response's `savedCents` is `(baseline cost − actual cost)` for the tokens used, where the baseline is **the model the client asked for** — the counterfactual of "what this request would have cost without the router". Claude Code pins a model on every request (that is what `--force-route` overrides), so an opus-pinned request routed to Sonnet books the real opus→sonnet saving, and one the coordinator pin keeps on Opus books exactly `$0.00`. The proxy falls back to `defaultModel` only when the client named nothing usable: no `model` field, `"auto"`, or a model with no pricing entry. **Prompt-cache tokens are included** — reads bill at 10% of the input rate and writes at 125% — so figures stay accurate for cache-heavy clients like Claude Code. Every routed request is appended to `~/.claude-router/history.jsonl`, so savings survive restarts (`claude-router stats` / the dashboard's *Lifetime Saved* card).

`history.jsonl` is append-only by design and never rotated — it *is* the lifetime-savings ledger (~250 bytes/event; a million routed requests ≈ 250 MB). Archive or delete it anytime to start fresh; stats restart from zero. The daemon log (`~/.claude-router/proxy.log`) *does* rotate: past 5 MiB it rolls over to `proxy.log.1` on the next daemon start.

Pricing tracks the **current Claude generation**; unknown/dated/Bedrock/Vertex IDs are priced by family so the math stays correct across model launches:

| Model | ID | Input $/1M | Output $/1M |
|-------|-----|-----------:|------------:|
| Claude Opus 4.8 | `claude-opus-4-8` | $5.00 | $25.00 |
| Claude Sonnet 5 | `claude-sonnet-5` | $3.00 | $15.00 |
| Claude Haiku 4.5 | `claude-haiku-4-5` | $1.00 | $5.00 |

> Sonnet 5 has an introductory rate of **$2.00 / $10.00** per 1M through 2026-08-31. Savings use the **standard** $3.00 / $15.00 so numbers stay stable when the intro ends — override via `pricing` to reflect the intro rate, or for negotiated/enterprise rates.

Every response also carries the decision as headers:

```text
x-router-tier: haiku
x-router-model: claude-haiku-4-5
x-router-cost-cents: 0.045
x-router-saved-cents: 1.200
x-router-classifier: heuristic
x-router-classifier-ms: 0.1
x-router-confidence: 0.9
```

## Other providers

The proxy binds to `127.0.0.1` by default — only your own machine can reach it.

> ⚠️ **Fable on Bedrock / Vertex is not wired up.** Fable 5's inference-profile ID on those platforms is unverified, so the `fable` tier resolves to **Opus** there rather than risking a 404 — a request routed to fable on Bedrock or Vertex silently runs on Opus instead. This is inert while `routing.allowFable` is off (the default). If you enable fable on Bedrock or Vertex, set the real ID yourself via `tiers.fable` in `~/.claude-router/config.json` and verify it against your console first. On the first-party Anthropic API, fable routes to `claude-fable-5` as expected.

### AWS Bedrock

```bash
npm install @anthropic-ai/bedrock-sdk

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=... AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=... AWS_REGION=us-east-1 \
  npx @sheruq/claude-router start --provider bedrock --port 4000
# auth comes from AWS env vars — no x-api-key needed
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000
```

### Google Vertex AI

```bash
npm install @anthropic-ai/vertex-sdk
gcloud auth application-default login

ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=my-project \
  npx @sheruq/claude-router start --provider vertex --port 4000
```

---

## Use as a library

Prefer to route inside your own app instead of running a proxy? Import it directly.

```bash
npm install @sheruq/claude-router
```

```typescript
import { createRouter } from '@sheruq/claude-router';

const router = createRouter({ apiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY!, verbose: true });

const response = await router.send({
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Translate to French: Hello world' }],
  max_tokens: 100,
});

console.log(response.meta.tier);       // 'haiku'
console.log(response.meta.savedCents); // 1.2
```

**Streaming** — `await router.stream(...)` classifies first, then returns the real SDK `MessageStream`; `meta` resolves after the stream completes:

```typescript
const { stream, meta } = await router.stream({
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Write a detailed essay on quantum computing' }],
  max_tokens: 4096,
});

for await (const event of stream) {
  // standard @anthropic-ai/sdk stream events; .on()/.finalMessage() work too
}

const routeMeta = await meta;
console.log(routeMeta.tier); // 'sonnet'
```

**Force a tier / read session stats:**

```typescript
await router.send({ messages: [/* … */], max_tokens: 50, tier: 'opus' }); // skip the classifier

console.log(router.stats());
// { totalCostCents: 5.3, totalSavedCents: 47.3, callCount: 120,
//   tierBreakdown: { haiku: 72, sonnet: 41, opus: 7 } }
```

<details>
<summary><strong>Full <code>createRouter</code> options and <code>RouteMeta</code> shape</strong></summary>

```typescript
const router = createRouter({
  apiKey: 'sk-...',
  classifier: 'hybrid',            // 'heuristic' | 'ai' | 'hybrid' (default: 'hybrid')
  defaultModel: 'claude-sonnet-5', // baseline for savings (default: sonnet tier)
  tiers: {                         // override model IDs per tier
    haiku: 'claude-haiku-4-5',
    sonnet: 'claude-sonnet-5',
    opus: 'claude-opus-4-8',
  },
  pricing: {                       // override $/1M token pricing
    'claude-sonnet-5': { input: 3.0, output: 15.0 },
  },
  fallback: true,                  // auto-fallback to next tier on rate limit (default: true)
  verbose: true,                   // log routing decisions (default: false)
  routing: {                       // classifier tuning (defaults shown)
    haikuMax: 30,                  // score below this → haiku
    opusMin: 70,                   // score above this → opus
    hybridBand: [40, 60],          // hybrid confirms with AI inside this band
    aiTimeoutMs: 1500,             // AI classifier timeout → heuristic fallback
    classifyCacheSize: 500,        // LRU size for AI results (0 disables)
    allowHaikuInAgentic: false,    // let trivial tool-using turns reach haiku (default: floor at sonnet)
  },
});
```

Every `send` / `stream` response includes a `meta` object:

```typescript
interface RouteMeta {
  tier: 'haiku' | 'sonnet' | 'opus';
  model: string;
  inputTokens: number;
  outputTokens: number;
  costCents: number;          // actual cost in cents
  savedCents: number;         // vs baseline (negative when routed to opus)
  classifierMethod: 'heuristic' | 'ai';
  classifierMs: number;
  confidence: number;         // 0–1
  fallbackUsed: boolean;      // rate-limited and escalated
  retried: boolean;           // auto-retried on bad output
  retryReason: string | null; // 'truncation' | 'refusal' | null
}
```

</details>

## Authentication & security

The proxy forwards whatever credentials your app already sends — no extra config:

| Method | Header | Use case |
|--------|--------|----------|
| API key | `x-api-key: sk-ant-...` | Anthropic API (pay-per-token) |
| Bearer token | `Authorization: Bearer <token>` | Claude Code / subscription auth |
| Env vars | — | AWS Bedrock, Google Vertex AI |

> **Security.** The proxy binds to `127.0.0.1` by default — only your own machine can reach it. If you pass `--host 0.0.0.0` to share it on a network, note that with the `bedrock`/`vertex` providers it calls out with **your** cloud credentials and does not authenticate incoming requests.
