# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
npm run build          # TypeScript → dist/ (chmod via node — Windows-safe)
npm test               # Build + run all tests (node:test, quoted glob — cmd.exe-safe)
npm run dev            # tsc --watch
node --test dist/__tests__/classifier.test.js  # Run single test file (build first)
```

## Architecture

**claude-router** is a routing layer that auto-routes Claude API calls across Haiku/Sonnet/Opus/Fable by evidence-based gates. The routing engine (classifier, cost model, tier fallback, retry/escalation) is the project's own; it builds on `@anthropic-ai/sdk` as the transport to Anthropic (and its Bedrock/Vertex siblings) and stays drop-in compatible with it.

```
ClaudeRouter.send(params)
  → Classifier (heuristic | ai | hybrid) → picks tier
  → Anthropic SDK messages.create() with resolved model
  → On RateLimitError: fallback to next tier up
  → CostTracker records meta (cost, savings vs baseline)
  → Returns RoutedMessage (Anthropic.Message + RouteMeta)
```

### Key files

- `src/types.ts` — All interfaces (Tier, RouterConfig, RoutingTuning, RouteMeta, RoutedMessage, RouterStats, ClassifyInput/Result)
- `src/models.ts` — Pricing constants, `computeCostCents()`, `computeRouteCost()` (cost + savings for a completed response), tier→model mapping
- `src/classifier.ts` — AI classification via Haiku, hybrid mode, unified `classify()` entry point with LRU cache. Tier selection itself lives in `src/routing.ts`
- `src/cache.ts` — Generic bounded `LruCache` (classification results, per-credential SDK clients)
- `src/route.ts` — `executeRoute()`: the shared routing-execution kernel (normalize → create → rate-limit walk-up → escalation retry), returns a `RouteResult` (see Retry / escalation)
- `src/totals.ts` — Shared route-event aggregation: `RouteTotals`, `emptyTotals()`, pure `foldOutcome(acc, e)` over the minimal `RouteOutcomeLike` shape (see Route aggregation)
- `src/tracker.ts` — CostTracker folds each `RouteMeta` via `foldOutcome` into a `RouteTotals`, maps to `RouterStats` (O(1) memory; no per-call array)
- `src/routing.ts` — `routeByEvidence()`: gate-based tier selection (see Routing)
- `src/params.ts` — `normalizeParamsForTier()`: strips/adapts model-specific params to the routed tier (see Parameter normalization)
- `src/index.ts` — ClaudeRouter class, `createRouter()` factory, re-exports

### Pricing (`src/models.ts`)

`computeCostCents()` accepts optional prompt-cache tokens (5th param): cache reads bill at `cacheReadRate(price)` and writes at `CACHE_WRITE_RATE` (125%) of the input rate. Both routed paths pass `usage.cache_read_input_tokens`/`cache_creation_input_tokens` — omitting them understates every Claude Code cost figure.

**The cache-read multiplier is per-model, not a constant.** `CACHE_READ_RATE` (10%) is the default; `ModelPricing.cacheRead` overrides it, and Fable 5.1 / Mythos 5.1 read at **2.5%** ($0.25/1M against a $10/1M input rate). Resolve it through `cacheReadRate()` — never read the constant directly at a cost site. On a cache-heavy client the read line is most of the input bill, so a global 10% overstated a fable route ~4x on that component. The field is optional, so every existing entry and every user `pricing` override keeps the standard rate: absent means standard, never free (same principle as `priced`).

Pricing is **family-based**, not per-ID. `priceForModel()` resolves an exact ID match first (so user overrides win), then falls back to the model's family (`familyForModel()` matches on `haiku`/`sonnet`/`opus`/`fable` substrings). This keeps `savedCents` correct for dated snapshots and Bedrock/Vertex `us.anthropic.*` IDs without a code change. Default tiers (`DEFAULT_MODELS`): haiku→`claude-haiku-4-5`, sonnet→`claude-sonnet-5`, opus→`claude-opus-4-8`, fable→`claude-fable-5-1`. Current generation (`FAMILY_PRICING`, $/1M in/out): Haiku 4.5 $1/$5, Sonnet 5 $2/$10, Opus 4.5–4.8 $5/$25, Fable 5/5.1 $10/$50. **Opus is NOT the old $15/$75 — drift here silently corrupts every savings figure.**

**Sonnet's $2/$10 is the standard rate, and pricing a scheduled change before it happens is the same bug as not tracking one.** $2/$10 shipped as introductory pricing through 2026-08-31; this table deliberately held the announced $3/$15 successor so savings math would not jump when it expired. It never expired — Anthropic made $2/$10 standard and cancelled the 2026-09-01 increase. The sonnet tier is the savings baseline, so every `savedCents`, dashboard card and `x-router-saved-cents` header was computed against a baseline 50% too expensive — and **a baseline error does not pass through to a saving, it amplifies**, because a saving is `baseline − actual` and only one side moved. On a representative Claude Code turn (110K cached prefix, 800 in, 1200 out) a haiku route reported $0.0356 against a true $0.0178: the baseline was off 1.5x, the reported saving off **2x**. Price what the table says today, and reason about baseline drift in terms of the delta it feeds, not the rate itself — this is the one constant every reported figure in the product is measured against.

`DEFAULT_PRICING` is assembled as family-derived entries ← spread ← `DIVERGENT_PRICING`. The latter is the exported table of models the family fallback would misprice, in three shapes: **legacy generations** whose family rate moved on without them (Opus 4.0/4.1 at `$15/$75`, 3x current; Sonnet 4/4.5/4.6 at `$3/$15`, 1.5x current — these became divergent the moment Sonnet 5's cut landed, having free-ridden on the fallback until then); **no family at all** (Mythos 5 / 5.1 — no substring for `familyForModel` to key on, so the fallback prices them at *nothing*); and **divergence on `cacheRead` alone** (Fable 5.1, whose base $10/$50 *is* its family's). Fable 5 is a tier now, so the family fallback covers it. Adding a divergent model is one row there — `models.test.ts` derives its exclusion set from the same table, in both directions, so a redundant or missing entry fails the build instead of rotting. Enumerating a superseded generation is open-ended by nature: an unlisted dated snapshot still falls through to the cheaper family rate, which is the accepted cost of having a fallback at all.

**The savings baseline is the model the client asked for, not `defaultModel`.** `computeRouteCost` takes the baseline as a parameter; the proxy resolves it per request in `resolveBaselineModel` (`handler.ts`) from the body's `model` field, and threads it through both handlers — `apiParams` has `model` stripped, so `handleMessages` is the last place that still knows it. The counterfactual `savedCents` answers is "what would this request have cost without the router", and Claude Code pins a model on **every** request — that is the entire reason `--force-route` exists. Pricing opus-pinned traffic against a fixed sonnet constant reported a *loss* on runs that saved: a measured sandbox session spent $3.34 against a $4.23 all-opus counterfactual, a 21% saving the dashboard rendered as −$0.80. Do not re-pin the baseline to `config.defaultModel` — that field is the library's own baseline and is the fallback here, used only when the client named nothing usable (no `model`, `"auto"`, or an unpriced ID, where a baseline would be invented rather than measured; falling back keeps the event `priced` exactly as before).

**Unpriced models are loud, never free.** A model with no exact entry *and* no family match is not $0 — it's unknown, and the old `if (!p) return 0` collapsed the two (this is what shipped Fable 5 at zero cost). `computeCostCents` stays a pure math function returning 0; `computeRouteCost` — the path every routed call takes — raises the signal: `RouteCost.priced` is false when the routed model, the baseline, or both are unpriced (an unpriced baseline makes `savedCents` just as wrong), plus one `console.warn` per model ID. `priced: false` flows into `RouteMeta`/`RouteEvent` → `foldOutcome` → `RouteTotals.unpricedModels`, which `stats`, the dashboard, and the verbose log render as "unknown" rather than `$0.00`. The field is written **only when false**, so pre-existing `history.jsonl` lines keep counting as measured.

### Routing (`src/routing.ts`)

**There is no score.** The additive 0–100 keyword scorer was removed: it let unrelated weak signals sum into an expensive decision (`matrix` +25 and `determinant` +25 reached the Opus threshold on a beginner numpy question, with neither word being evidence of difficulty). Summing was the bug, so no weight tuning could fix it. `routing.test.ts` pins that regression.

`routeByEvidence(input, opts)` returns `{ tier, reason, confidence }` under three rules:

1. **Sonnet is the default.** Leaving it requires positive evidence — absence of complexity is not evidence of simplicity (`"hi"` routes to sonnet, not haiku).
2. **Gates are conjunctive.** Every condition must hold, so two coincidental matches cannot combine into a verdict.
3. **The two traffic profiles are scored separately**, because they expose different signals.

**Agentic branch** (tools defined, or tool blocks in `messages`). The signal is `isMidLoop()` — is the last message a `tool_result`. This is the only routing signal in the codebase with a measurement behind it (`research/2026-07-21-tier-ceiling.md`: mid-loop tool selection is largely tier-insensitive, sonnet adequate 75% with zero clear losses; final synthesis is not, opus won 10 of 11). It is purely structural: no keywords, no language dependence, no verb-without-object failure mode.

**Single-turn branch.** Demotion to haiku requires **all** of: no tools, single message, short task text, no code fence, short system, no images, no depth markers, and a transform verb present. The boundary here is **unmeasured** — the attempt to measure it failed (`research/2026-07-21-single-turn-failed.md`) — so this branch is deliberately conservative rather than tuned. Do not widen the gate without evidence.

**Fable** is opt-in (`allowFable`) and needs depth **and** long-horizon signals together. Nothing measured supports predicting "super hard" from request text, and at $10/$50 a wrong promotion is the most expensive mistake the router can make.

Hybrid mode defers to the AI classifier exactly when no gate fired and routing fell through to the default (`reason` ends with `:default`). Both call sites use the unified `classify()` entry — do not reintroduce per-caller switch statements.

`ClassifyResult.reason` records which gate decided, so a routing decision is auditable after the fact. `routing.haikuMax` / `opusMin` / `hybridBand` are accepted-but-dead config knobs (marked `@deprecated`); they thresholded a score that no longer exists.

**`latestUserText()` is the one extractor — gates and AI snippet both use it.** It takes the newest user turn and strips `<system-reminder>…</system-reminder>` blocks, walking further back if a turn is nothing but injected context. Two separate bugs came from not doing this:

- Joining the whole message array let prior turns and `tool_result` payloads outvote the request (#18, fixed for the heuristic path in `5557d2c`; `buildAISnippet` was missed until #34).
- Keeping the injected context let the *project's own docs* decide the tier (#34). Claude Code injects CLAUDE.md into the user turn as its own text block. Captured from a real session: the opening request carries a 21,558-character injected block ahead of the user's 65 characters, and this CLAUDE.md contains "end-to-end" — a `DEPTH_MARKERS` hit — so `read package.json then tsconfig.json and tell me the build target` routed to **opus** via `agentic:depth-requested`. Any repo whose CLAUDE.md contains a depth word paid opus rates on every turn.

**The filter is structural, not textual.** An injected block is its own text block that opens and closes with the tag; whole blocks are dropped and nothing is parsed inside them. Do not replace this with a regex over the text. The first attempt did exactly that and failed *on this repo*: the paragraph above documents the tag, CLAUDE.md gets injected, and the literal closing tag ended the non-greedy match 8,039 characters in, leaving 13,519 characters of documentation still carrying the depth marker. Content can always mention the delimiter; block boundaries can't be forged by content. A block that merely mentions the tag mid-sentence is a real question and is kept.

**Quoted material is the subject, not the task.** Claude Code's meta-calls quote the conversation and state the instruction after it — `<session>…</session>\n\nWrite the title in the predominant language…`. Scoring the quoted prompt charged opus to name a session. On a 45-request wire corpus these meta-calls were 29% of all requests. The `<session>` region arrives inline in the same text block, so it is matched rather than dropped structurally, and the match is **greedy on purpose**: the real closing tag is last because the instruction follows it, so quoted text containing the literal tag cannot end the match early.

`buildAISnippet` head/tail-truncates the extractor's output, falling back to the joined text only when no user turn carries a request at all (`mode: 'ai'` bypasses the gates, so a pure tool_result history can reach it). Do not reintroduce a second extractor, and do not add a keyword gate that reads raw message content.

**Verified against real traffic** (`isMidLoop` fires correctly on Claude Code — a captured tool loop yields `agentic:mid-loop`; an earlier suspicion that the trailing `role: 'system'` message suppressed it was wrong).

**AI classifier never throws**: 1.5s `AbortSignal.timeout` + try/catch fall back to `classifyHeuristic()`. Only genuine `method: 'ai'` results are cached (sha1 key over normalized snippet/system/message count/tool count); heuristic fallbacks are recomputed so a transient Haiku outage isn't cached. Tuning knobs (`RouterConfig.routing` / `FileConfig.routing`): `aiTimeoutMs`, `classifyCacheSize` — optional. `haikuMax`/`opusMin`/`hybridBand` are accepted-but-dead (see Routing).

### Route aggregation

`src/totals.ts` owns the one fold that turns route events into running figures — "sum cost/saved, count per tier, bucket by day". Three call sites reuse it, each keeping its own execution model: `CostTracker.record` folds one `RouteMeta` at a time (O(1)), `history.foldLine` folds newly-appended JSONL lines behind an offset cache, and `dashboard` reduces the live `routeHistory` array. `foldOutcome(acc, e)` reads only `RouteOutcomeLike` (`tier`, `costCents`, `savedCents`, optional `retried`/`timestamp`/`model`/`priced`/`error`), so both `RouteMeta` and `RouteEvent` satisfy it structurally without a unified record. `priced === false` buckets the event into `RouteTotals.unpricedModels` (count per model ID) instead of contributing a fake zero — absent means priced, so legacy records aren't retroactively voided. An `error` event (a stream that died mid-flight) counts **only** toward `RouteTotals.errors` — its placeholder zeros stay out of the money/tier figures, same principle as unpriced. `RouteTotals.tiers` is string-keyed (holds `passthrough` too) and carries only tiers actually seen; the shared `tierBreakdown(totals, labels)` helper zero-fills a fixed label set (used by both `RouterStats.tierBreakdown` and the dashboard bars — add/rename a tier in one place). Do not reintroduce a second copy of the aggregation — extend `foldOutcome`. Line-parsing/corrupt-line rejection stays in `history` (its file seam), not in the shared fold.

### Retry / escalation

`src/retry.ts` — `shouldRetry()` checks two conditions on a completed response:
- **Truncation**: `stop_reason === 'max_tokens'` with >20 output tokens → escalate tier
- **Refusal (structural)**: `stop_reason === 'refusal'` → escalate tier. Language-independent, checked first. Branch on `stop_reason` **only** — the companion `stop_details` is informational and can be `null` on a genuine refusal. Escalation is uniform, not per-`stop_details.category`: opus has already returned by this point, so the only refusals reaching the check are on haiku/sonnet. `stop_reason` is widened to `string` before comparison because the pinned SDK's union predates the value.
- **Refusal (lexical)**: output <200 chars whose first 80 chars match `REFUSAL_PATTERNS` → escalate tier (anchored to the opening so quoted refusal phrases mid-answer don't false-positive). This is a **fallback**, not dead code: only Opus 4.7+/Sonnet 5/Fable 5 set the structural flag (Haiku 4.5, the default entry tier, never does), and soft refusals — the model declining conversationally rather than the classifier firing — arrive as `end_turn`. New languages need only reach the soft-refusal case.

`nextTier()` walks `TIER_ORDER` (haiku→sonnet→opus→fable) but stops at `ESCALATION_CEILING` (opus): fable is 2x opus and the escalation triggers have never fired on real traffic (`research/2026-07-21-detector-measurement.md`: 0 of 35,314 responses). `shouldRetry` gates on the same ceiling — deriving it from `TIER_ORDER.length` silently made opus retryable when fable was added.

`src/route.ts` `executeRoute(client, apiParams, startTier, models, { fallbackOnRateLimit })` is the one place this loop lives — shared by `ClaudeRouter.send` and the proxy `handleNonStreaming`. It normalizes for the tier's model, calls the API, optionally walks up `TIER_ORDER` on a `RateLimitError`, and escalates **once** on truncation/refusal — but only on the originally-classified tier's first response (`!fallbackUsed`), never after a rate-limit walk-up. The library passes `fallbackOnRateLimit: true` (config `fallback`), the proxy `false` (a 429 surfaces to the client). Both then price via `computeRouteCost` and record through their own sink (CostTracker / RouteEvent). Do not re-inline this loop at a caller — the two copies had already drifted on the escalation condition before this was unified. An unknown `startTier` throws a `TypeError` up front (indexOf -1 used to send `model: undefined` to the API), and the escalated retry is **best-effort**: if it fails (e.g. the escalated tier is rate-limited), the truncated/refused-but-real original response is served rather than letting the error reach the walk-up catch, which would discard it. Streaming paths don't use `executeRoute` (no retry once bytes flow).

**Library streaming** (`src/index.ts`): `stream()` is async — classification is awaited (it never throws by contract), then the caller gets `{ stream, meta }` where `stream` is the untouched SDK `MessageStream` and `meta` resolves from `finalMessage()`. `meta` is pre-marked handled (`meta.catch(() => {})`) so a caller consuming only the stream can't crash the host via unhandledRejection; awaiting it still surfaces errors. Do not reintroduce a synchronous return wrapping the stream in a Proxy — that shape broke `for await` and `.on()` chaining and shipped as the 0.2.x streaming bug. `MessageStream` is typed off the client surface (`ReturnType<Anthropic['messages']['stream']>`), never a deep `lib/` import.

### Parameter normalization

`src/params.ts` — `normalizeParamsForTier(params, tier)` is applied immediately before **every** routed `messages.create`/`stream` in both the library (`src/index.ts`) and the proxy (`src/proxy/handler.ts`), including escalated-retry calls. The router picks the model, so it must also strip/adapt model-coupled params or the request 400s on the routed model:
- **haiku** (Haiku 4.5): delete `thinking` (no adaptive support) and `output_config.effort` (unsupported). Sampling params kept.
- **sonnet/opus** (Sonnet 5 / Opus 4.8): delete `temperature`/`top_p`/`top_k`; rewrite `thinking:{type:'enabled',budget_tokens}` → `{type:'adaptive'}`.

Never touches `messages`/`system`/`tools`/`max_tokens`. This is what makes `--force-route` work with Claude Code (which sends adaptive thinking + effort, which Haiku rejects). The AI classifier builds its own clean request and is not normalized.

### Proxy server (`src/proxy/`)

HTTP proxy that sits in front of the Anthropic API — zero code changes needed on the client side.

```
src/proxy/
  server.ts     — Hono app, routes: GET /health (via buildHealth), GET /dashboard, POST /v1/messages
  handler.ts    — classify → call API → retry if needed → set x-router-* headers
  health.ts     — single source of truth for the /health contract: SERVICE_ID, HealthInfo type, buildHealth(). server.ts produces it; daemon.checkHealth and cli status consume it (see Health contract)
  dashboard.ts  — HTML dashboard; aggregates routeHistory via foldOutcome (src/totals.ts)
  cli.ts        — CLI dispatcher + commands; bin name `claude-router` (package.json `bin`)
  cli-config.ts — paths (routerPaths), FileConfig loading; one `OPTIONS` table drives parseServeArgs / serveArgsFrom / configFromOptions (see Serve options); getVersion, suggestCommand
  daemon.ts     — detached-spawn daemon, ~/.claude-router/daemon.json state, health polling, stopDaemon; calls rotateLogIfLarge at start
  log-rotate.ts — rotateLogIfLarge (proxy.log → proxy.log.1 at 5 MiB, only between daemon runs — never rotate under a live writer; #49)
  platform.ts   — per-OS autostart/env-var behind PlatformIntegration adapters (windows/macos/linux) + platformIntegration() selector; pure builders + cross-platform statusline stay outside the adapters; exported functions are thin delegators (see Platform integration)
  term.ts       — zero-dep ANSI styling (Claude Code aesthetic), tier colors, box(), NO_COLOR/TTY detection
  format.ts     — `formatSavedCents()`: the one place a saved/extra figure becomes text. An amount that rounds away renders as a neutral, unlabelled `$0.00` — never green `saved $0.00`, because a sub-cent loss is not a saving (same principle as unpriced models being loud rather than free)
  history.ts    — persistent route history (~/.claude-router/history.jsonl, append-only JSONL) with an incremental-read aggregate cache (folds via src/totals.ts); powers `stats` and the dashboard's lifetime cards. Only active when HandlerConfig.historyFile is set (the CLI sets it; tests/library don't). Deliberately NEVER rotated — it is the lifetime-savings ledger; users may archive/delete it (cache self-invalidates, totals restart from zero) and a one-per-process warn nudges archival past 100MB. Single-writer by design (the daemon's pre-start health check enforces one proxy per port).
```

**Health contract** (`src/proxy/health.ts`): the `/health` shape and the `'claude-router-proxy'` identity string live here once. `server.ts` builds the payload with `buildHealth(config, routeHistory)`; `daemon.checkHealth` imports `HealthInfo`/`SERVICE_ID` to verify the port is actually ours; `cli status` types its display off the same `HealthInfo`. Don't re-declare the shape or re-inline the identity string at a consumer.

**Platform integration** (`src/proxy/platform.ts`): OS-specific autostart + `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` env work lives in one `PlatformIntegration` adapter per OS (`windows`/`macos`/`linux`), selected once by `platformIntegration()`. macOS's `onStop` unloads the KeepAlive LaunchAgent (called by `daemon.stopDaemon` via the `unloadLaunchAgent` delegator). The exported `installAutostart`/`setEnvVar`/… functions are thin delegators to the current adapter, so call sites and tests are unchanged. Pure string builders (`buildPlist`/`buildSystemdUnit`/`buildRcBlock`/…) and the cross-platform statusline functions are shared and stay outside the adapters. Add per-OS behaviour to the adapter, not as a new `platformName()` switch.

Providers: `anthropic` (per-credential client from `x-api-key` or `Authorization: Bearer`, cached in an LRU of 100 via `getAnthropicClient()` to preserve keep-alive), `bedrock` (singleton `@anthropic-ai/bedrock-sdk`), `vertex` (singleton `@anthropic-ai/vertex-sdk`).

Passthrough: if `model` field is set and not `"auto"`, request bypasses routing and forwards directly to `api.anthropic.com` — **unless `--force-route` is set** (Claude Code always pins a model, so it needs `--force-route`). Passthrough only applies to the `anthropic` provider. The body is read **once as text** and forwarded verbatim; forwarded responses pipe `response.body` and must strip `content-encoding`/`content-length` (undici already decompressed).

**Coordinator-session pin** (`HandlerConfig.sessionModel`, CLI `--session-model <tier>` / `FileConfig.sessionModel`): pins the Claude Code **main session** to one tier while subagents still route by evidence. The signal is the gateway protocol's `x-claude-code-agent-id` header — Claude Code sets it **only** on requests from a subagent it spawned, so a request *without* it is not a subagent. **Not-a-subagent is not the same as the coordinator's agent turn**, which is why the pin also requires `body.tools` to be non-empty. Claude Code's meta-calls (session title, summary) arrive without the header too, and they are exactly the `<session>…</session>` quoted-prompt shape `latestUserText` exists to route cheap — 29% of requests on the wire corpus. Pinning them charged opus rates to name a session (measured against live Claude Code v2.1.220: the title call went sonnet → opus the moment `--session-model opus` was on). Every real coordinator turn ships Claude Code's tool set (165–217 tools observed); the meta-calls ship none, so this is the same structural agentic/single-turn split `routing.ts` already makes — **do not replace it with a text test on the prompt.** A genuinely tool-less coordinator turn degrades to classification, which is the cheap path anyway. When `sessionModel` is set, `!isSubagent`, and tools are present, `handleMessages` skips the classifier and synthesizes a `ClassifyResult` with `method: 'pinned'` / `reason: 'session:coordinator-pinned'` (so headers/log/history record it uniformly — `method` is widened to `'heuristic' | 'ai' | 'pinned'`). It **degrades safely**: a config typo whose tier has no `models[tier]` entry falls back to classification rather than sending `model: undefined`. Only meaningful under `--force-route` (otherwise the client's pinned model already passes through); the banner flags when it can't take effect. Verified against live Claude Code traffic (main session sends the header; subagents carry `x-claude-code-agent-id`).

`routeHistory` is an in-memory capped array (max 1000 events) used by `/dashboard`.

Streaming responses only set `x-router-tier/model/classifier/confidence` headers (cost/saved aren't known until the stream finishes); non-streaming sets the full `x-router-*` set including cost and savings.

**Streaming error contract** (`handleStreaming`): the first stream event is awaited **before** the Response is committed, so pre-stream failures (401 auth, 400 validation, connection refused → 502) return their real HTTP status via the shared `apiErrorResponse` mapper — never a `200` carrying an SSE error frame. Once headers are out, a mid-stream failure emits the SSE `event: error` frame *and* records a `RouteEvent` with `error` set so it lands in `RouteTotals.errors` instead of vanishing. `apiErrorResponse` gates on a **numeric** `status` — `APIConnectionError` is APIError-shaped with `status: undefined`, and passing that to `c.json` silently produced a 200.

**No CORS, on purpose** (`server.ts`): every legitimate consumer is same-origin (dashboard) or CORS-exempt (Node fetch). The old wildcard let any webpage in the operator's browser POST /v1/messages to localhost and read the response. A test pins the header's absence — do not add `cors()` back.

### CLI (`src/proxy/cli.ts`)

Subcommands: `start` (foreground; `-d`/`--daemon` for background), `stop`, `restart`, `status`, `stats [--json]`, `logs [-f] [-n N]`, `install`/`uninstall` (**cross-platform**: detached daemon + per-OS autostart — Windows HKCU Run key, macOS LaunchAgent, Linux systemd user unit — plus env var via setx/rc-block and a node-based Claude Code statusline), `init` (scaffold config), `doctor` (diagnostics, exit code = failure count), `help`, `-V`/`--version`. Unknown subcommands error with a Levenshtein suggestion (no more silent fallthrough to `start`); bare flags still run `start` behind a deprecation warning. Install steps report honestly — ✓ only after the daemon's `/health` actually passes.

`cli.js` dispatches only when it is the entry script (`require.main === module`) — tests import `startServer`/`readLogTail` from it, and before the guard a bare import ran `main()` against the importer's argv. `startServer` maps `EADDRINUSE`/`EACCES` to clean messages (listen failures are server `'error'` events, invisible to the `unhandledRejection` handler) and takes an injectable `onFatal` for tests; the SIGINT/SIGTERM graceful-close handlers live in `cmdStart`, not in the helper, because they're process-global. `cmdLogs` reads a bounded tail via `readLogTail` (last 256KB, or `[fromByte, EOF)` when following; a shrink re-tails) — never the whole file.

`--upstream <url>` (`FileConfig.upstream`, default `https://api.anthropic.com`) redirects where routed *and* passed-through requests go, including the classifier's own Haiku call. It exists so the proxy can be exercised end to end without credentials or spend — previously that meant editing `DEFAULT_UPSTREAM` inside `node_modules` (see `research/2026-07-21-end-to-end-savings.md`). It is **explicit-only and never read from the environment**: the 0.2.1 self-recursion bug was the proxy inheriting `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` and calling itself, and a flag someone has to type cannot be inherited by accident. `getAnthropicClient` keys its cache on upstream as well as credential — a cached client carries its `baseURL`. A non-default upstream is always shown on the startup banner, because silently sending traffic somewhere other than Anthropic is the worst possible failure to hide.

The proxy binds `127.0.0.1` by default (`--host` / `FileConfig.host` to override). This is a security boundary, not a convenience: with `bedrock`/`vertex` the proxy uses the operator's cloud credentials and does not authenticate incoming requests — do not change the default bind.

Config file: `~/.claude-router/config.json` (`FileConfig`) supplies defaults for every flag plus `tiers` (per-tier model ID overrides), `pricing` (per-ID `$/1M` overrides), and `routing` (classifier tuning). **CLI flags always override the file.** Precedence for tier→model: provider defaults (`DEFAULT_MODELS`/`BEDROCK_MODELS`/`VERTEX_MODELS`) ← spread ← config `tiers`.

**Serve options** (`cli-config.ts`): the CLI flag set is one declarative `OPTIONS` table (key, flags, kind, default, emit rules). `parseServeArgs` (file defaults ← flags, throws `CliUsageError` on bad/unknown flags), `serveArgsFrom` (rebuild spawn args), and `configFromOptions` (scaffold `init`'s config.json) all fold over it — a new flag is one row, not five parallel edits. Emit predicates key off each option's `default`, so a value and "when to omit it" can't disagree. `tiers`/`pricing`/`routing` are file-only (no flag) and pass through untouched.

### Testing

Tests use `node:test` (no external test framework). Router tests mock the `_client` property directly — no network calls. Most tests are pure unit tests; a few bind an ephemeral **loopback** TCP port (`serve({ port: 0 })` / `http.createServer().listen(0)`) to exercise the proxy over a real socket — `daemon.test.ts` (health polling) and `integration.test.ts` (full end-to-end against a fake in-process Anthropic upstream). None reach the public internet by default. The two `proxy.test.ts` passthrough cases that *do* call `api.anthropic.com` are skipped unless `RUN_NETWORK_TESTS=1` is set.

### Module system

ES2022 target, Node16 module resolution. All internal imports use `.js` extension suffix.
