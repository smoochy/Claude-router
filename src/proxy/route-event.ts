 * The proxy's route outcome record — one line of `history.jsonl`, one row of the
 * dashboard, one fold into `RouteTotals`.
 *
 * It lives here rather than in `handler.ts` because four modules (`history`,
 * `dashboard`, `health`, `server`) need the shape and none of them needs the
 * request handler. With the type declared inside the handler, the 617-line file
 * that answers HTTP requests was also the type root for the whole proxy subtree.
 *
 * Construction goes through {@link buildRouteEvent} / {@link errorRouteEvent} so
 * the record is assembled once. The non-streaming path, the streaming success
 * path and the streaming error path each used to spell all fourteen fields out
 * inline, and they had already diverged: the streaming paths hardcoded
 * `retried: false` and none of the three carried the classifier timing that the
 * `x-router-classifier-ms` header reports.
