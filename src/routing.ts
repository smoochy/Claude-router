/**
 * Evidence-based tier selection.
 *
 * Replaces the additive 0-100 keyword score. That design let unrelated weak
 * signals sum into an expensive decision — "matrix" (+25) and "determinant"
 * (+25) reached the Opus threshold on a beginner numpy question, with neither
 * word being evidence of difficulty. Summing is the bug, not the weights.
 *
 * Three rules replace it:
 *
 *  1. **Sonnet is the default.** Leaving it requires positive evidence.
 *  2. **Gates are conjunctive.** Every condition must hold, so two coincidental
 *     matches cannot combine into a verdict.
 *  3. **The two traffic profiles are scored differently**, because they expose
 *     different signals. Agentic sessions carry loop position; single-turn API
 *     requests carry request shape. Neither signal exists in the other profile.
 *
 * Evidence and its limits — see `research/`:
 *  - Loop position is measured (`2026-07-21-tier-ceiling.md`): mid-loop tool
 *    selection is largely tier-insensitive (sonnet adequate 75%, never a clear
 *    loss), while final synthesis is not (opus won 10 of 11).
 *  - The single-turn boundary is **unmeasured** — the attempt to measure it
 *    failed (`2026-07-21-single-turn-failed.md`). That branch is therefore
 *    deliberately conservative rather than tuned, and the haiku gate is narrow
 *    by choice, not by calibration.
 *  - Nothing licenses automatic promotion to fable, which is why it is opt-in.
