/**
 * The routing execution kernel, shared by all four routed paths: the library's
 * `ClaudeRouter.send`/`stream` and the proxy's `handleNonStreaming`/
 * `handleStreaming`. Given a chosen tier it validates the tier, resolves its
 * model and normalizes the request for that model — and, for the non-streaming
 * entry, calls the API, optionally walks up on rate limits, and escalates once
 * if the response is truncated or a refusal.
 *
 * Keeping this in one module is what makes routing semantics consistent across
 * the callers — before, each re-implemented the loop and they had already
 * drifted on the escalation condition.
 *
 * Retry is deliberately non-streaming only: there is no retry once bytes have
 * flowed. That is why {@link startRouteStream} stops after opening the stream
 * rather than sharing `executeRoute`'s loop. What it does share is everything
 * *before* the call — which the two streaming callers used to re-implement, with
 * `stream()` growing a second unknown-tier `TypeError` that read its expected
 * tiers from a different source than this one.
