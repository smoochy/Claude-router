 * Current-generation Claude pricing ($ per 1M tokens), keyed by tier/family.

 *   Haiku 4.5 — $1.00 / $5.00
 *   Sonnet 5  — $2.00 / $10.00
 *   Opus 5 / 4.5/4.6/4.7/4.8 — $5.00 / $25.00  (note: NOT the old $15/$75 of
 *     Opus 4.0/4.1. Opus 5 ships at the same rate as 4.8, so promoting the opus
 *     tier to it changes no cost figure — only the model ID.)
 *
 *   Fable 5 / 5.1 — $10.00 / $50.00 (2x Opus; the most expensive routable tier)
 *
 * **Sonnet's $2/$10 is the standard rate, not a discount.** It shipped as an
 * introductory rate through 2026-08-31, and we deliberately priced Sonnet at the
 * announced $3/$15 successor so savings math would not jump when the intro
 * expired. It never expired: Anthropic made $2/$10 standard and cancelled the
 * 2026-09-01 increase. Guessing the *direction* of a scheduled change is the
 * same bet as not tracking it — the sonnet tier is the savings baseline, so the
 * whole ledger overstated every win for as long as the guess stood. Price what
 * the table says today; there is no forward-looking rate.
 *
 * Pricing drift here silently corrupts every `savedCents` figure the router
 * reports — keep this in sync when a new generation ships, and rely on the
 * family fallback in `priceForModel` to cover Bedrock/Vertex/dated IDs.

 *    the whole prior generation by a third.
 *  - **Mythos 5 / 5.1** match no family at all (`familyForModel` has no substring
 *    to key on), so the fallback prices them at *nothing* — see `warnIfUnpriced`
 *    for what happens when a model reaches that state. Fable 5 no longer needs an
 *    entry here: it is a tier now, so the family fallback resolves it.
 *  - **Fable 5.1** diverges on `cacheRead` alone — the base $10/$50 is its
 *    family's, but its cache reads bill at 2.5% instead of 10%.
 *
 * Enumerating a superseded generation is open-ended by nature: a dated snapshot
 * ID that is not listed here still falls through to the (now cheaper) family
 * rate. That is the accepted cost of a family fallback, and it is why the entries
 * below cover the dateless IDs plus the dated snapshots we have actually seen on
 * the wire, rather than pretending the list is exhaustive.
 *
 * Every entry here must genuinely diverge from its family (or have no family);
 * `models.test.ts` asserts that, so a redundant entry fails the build rather
 * than quietly rotting. Keeping the divergent set as its own exported table is
 * also what lets that test derive its exclusions instead of hand-maintaining a
 * parallel list that silently drifts.
